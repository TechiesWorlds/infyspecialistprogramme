You are given two integers n and k. Find k-th smallest divisor of n, or report that it doesn't exist.

Divisor of n is any such natural number, that n can be divided by it without remainder.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1015, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output
If n has less than k divisors, output -1.

Otherwise, output the k-th smallest divisor of n.

Note
In the first example, number 4 has three divisors: 1, 2 and 4. The second one is 2.

In the second example, number 5 has only two divisors: 1 and 5. The third divisor doesn't exist, so the answer is -1.

Solution:
def findkth(n,k):
v=[]
p=int(sqrt(n))+1
for i in range(1,p,1):
if(n%i==0):
v.append(i)
if(i!=sqrt(n));
v.append(n/i);
v.sort(reverse=False)
if(k>len(v)):
print("Doesnot Exist")
else:
print(v[k-1])

if __name__=='__main__':
n=15
k=2
findkth(n,k)
